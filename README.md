# sushi_game
*The final assignment for COMP 401 - Fundamentals of Programming. The task included taking a bare user interface (Assignment 9 Initial Start File.jar) and adding increased functionality to both the GUI using JSwing as well as internal functionality of the logic using Java to come to a final game/simulation (Runnable Assignment 9.jar).*

**Concepts used:**

- Model-View-Controller Framework
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Observer/Observable
- Inheritance
- Interfaces
- UI Design
- Other common programming fundamentals

**Instructions:**

- Both .jar files are runnable, one shows the initial task, the other my final, altered submission.
- The game simulates a sushi conveyor belt and allows the player to add plates of certain colors and content to the belt as well as rotate the belt.
- AI users will remove/eat sushi as the player rotates the belt
